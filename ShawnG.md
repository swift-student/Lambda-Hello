Hello, my name is Shawn Gee. Three words that describe me (according to my wife) are lazy, unmotivated, and stupid. I am living in Fairbanks, Alaska and plan to stay here forever. We enjoy walking in the snow (which I just did during my lunch break), freezing our asses off, and building snowmen. I will probably quit Lambda because I'm an idiot. No point even trying.
